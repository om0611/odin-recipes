    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A dosa is a popular South Indian dish, usually enjoyed with sambhar and coconut chutney. 
        It is made from a fermented batter of rice flour and urad dal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice Flour</li>
        <li>Urad Dal</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Cooking Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the urad dal and soak it in water.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups of water to the rice flour and whisk it. Let the rice flour soak for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Drain the excess water from the urad dal and grind it without adding water.</li>
        <li>Now add water and grind the urad dal to a smooth batter.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked rice flour along with water and salt to the batter, and grind the batter again.</li>
        <li>Leave the batter overnight or at least for 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Now, the batter would have raised well. Mix the batter well and add some water if it is too thick.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan and pour a ladleful of batter in the pan.</li>
        <li>Spread the batter thinly and uniformly.</li>
        <li>Let the dosa cook till you see it turning golden brown from the bottom.</li>
        <li>Drizzle one or two tsp of oil all over the dosa.</li>
        <li>Let the dosa turn crispy. Once done, fold the dosa and serve it with sambhar and your favourite chutney.</li>
    </ol>
